# Mobile_Data_Acquisition
*Mobile inertial sensors data collector and streamer - IOS/Android* 

<br> <br> 
Part of the following effort: 
**HARNESSING THE POWER OF GENERATIVE MODELS FOR MOBILE CONTINUOUS AND IMPLICIT AUTHENTICATION**

Interconnecting the following works: 
* Generative AI Models
* Continous Authentication 
* Implicit Authentication 
* Outlier Detection 

### Abstract 
Authenticating a user’s identity lies at the heart of securing any information system.
A trade off exists currently between user experience and the level of security the system
abides by. Using Continuous and Implicit Authentication a user’s identity can be verified
without any active participation, hence increasing the level of security, given the continuous
verification aspect, as well as the user experience, given its implicit nature.
This thesis studies using mobile devices inertial sensors data to identify unique movements and patterns that identify the owner of the device at all times. We implement,
and evaluate approaches proposed in related works as well as novel approaches based on a
variety of machine learning models, specifically a new kind of Auto Encoder (AE) named
Variational Auto Encoder (VAE), relating to the generative models family. We evaluate
numerous machine learning models for the anomaly detection or outlier detection case of
spotting a malicious user, or an unauthorised entity currently using the smartphone system. We evaluate the results under conditions similar to other works as well as under
conditions typically observed in real-world applications. We find that the shallow VAE
is the best performer semi-supervised anomaly detector in our evaluations and hence the
most suitable for the design proposed.
The thesis concludes with recommendations for the enhancement of the system and
the research body dedicated to the domain of Continuous and Implicit Authentication for
mobile security.
